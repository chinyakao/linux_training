# Git Patch Application: `git am` vs `git apply`

## `git apply`
- **Purpose**: Applies a patch to the working directory.
- **Does NOT create a commit**.
- **Does NOT preserve author or commit metadata**.
- **Used for**: Applying raw diffs or patches manually.
- **Patch format**: Unified diff (from `git diff` or `diff`).

**Example**:
```bash
git apply my-fix.patch
```

## `git am`
- **Purpose**: Applies a patch and creates a commit.
- **Preserves author, date, and commit message**.
- **Used for**: Applying patches generated via `git format-patch`, often in email-based workflows.
- **Patch format**: Email-style patch (includes headers like `From:`, `Date:`, `Subject:`).

**Example**:
```bash
git am 0001-fix-bug.patch
```

## Patch Format Types

### 1. **Email Format Patch** (for `git am`)
- Generated by: `git format-patch`
- Includes:
  - `From:` (author)
  - `Date:`
  - `Subject:` (commit message)
  - `Signed-off-by:`
  - Diff content
- Ends with: `--` separator and Git version info

**Example**:
```bash
git format-patch HEAD~1
```

### 2. **Unified Diff Format** (for `git apply`)
- Generated by: `git diff`
- Contains only file changes
- No commit metadata

**Example**:
```bash
git diff > changes.patch
```
